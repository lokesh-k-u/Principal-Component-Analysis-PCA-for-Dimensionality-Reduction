# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for Dimensionality Reduction

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for **dimensionality reduction** using a real-world dataset. PCA is a powerful technique that helps reduce the number of features while preserving important information, making machine learning models faster and more efficient.

## 📊 Dataset
We use a real-world dataset (e.g., **Wine dataset** or **Iris dataset**) available in `scikit-learn`. The dataset consists of multiple features, and we apply PCA to reduce dimensionality while retaining essential information.

## 🔥 Implementation Steps
1. **Load the dataset**
2. **Explore & preprocess the data** (handle missing values, normalize features, etc.)
3. **Apply PCA** to reduce dimensionality
4. **Visualize variance explained** by principal components
5. **Compare model performance before & after PCA**
6. **Analyze the impact of PCA on classification accuracy**

## 📈 Results & Insights
✅ PCA reduces the number of features while keeping key patterns.
✅ The explained variance graph helps in selecting the optimal number of components.
✅ Model performance before & after PCA is compared to check effectiveness.
✅ PCA can remove noise and improve computation time for large datasets.
